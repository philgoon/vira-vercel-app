# ViRA Project Workflow Enhancement - Coder Plan

## Enhancement Request [R5.1]
Replace "Project Details" button with workflow-based buttons on projects page:

**Workflow Logic**:
1. **Active Projects** â†’ "Complete Project" button â†’ Changes status to "completed"
2. **Completed Projects** â†’ "Rate Project" button â†’ Opens rating form â†’ Changes status to "archived" 
3. **Archived Projects** â†’ "Edit Ratings" button â†’ Opens rating form with existing data

## Assessment Phase [EC] âœ… COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis âœ… COMPLETED
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - 95% Confidence
**Findings**:
1. âœ… **Current Projects Page**: Uses "View Details" button - needs replacement
2. âœ… **Database Status Values**: Perfect workflow match:
   - 65 "active" projects â†’ need "Complete Project" button
   - 260 "completed" projects â†’ need "Rate Project" button  
   - 1 "archived" project â†’ need "Edit Ratings" button
3. âœ… **Existing APIs**: 
   - Projects API: GET/POST only (need PUT for status updates)
   - Ratings API: GET with filtering capability âœ…
   - Rate-project API: Handles creation + archiving âœ…

### Phase 2: Technical Feasibility [TDT] âœ… COMPLETED
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - 95% Confidence
**Requirements Assessment**:
1. âœ… **Status Transition API**: Need PUT method in projects API
2. âœ… **Button Conditional Logic**: Straightforward based on project.status
3. âœ… **Rating Form Integration**: Can use query params for project_id
4. âœ… **Edit Mode**: Ratings API supports project filtering for pre-fill
